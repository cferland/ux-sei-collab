            Established in 1920, The Waverly Inn was reopened in 2006. Tucked into the ground floors of two adjoining townhouses, the dinning room's red booths, fireplaces, and low amber lighting provide an attractive and cozy hangout for the city's best and brightest. The menu features American classics alongside contemporary seasonal dishes using organic, local ingredients.
